/**
 * Cross-process serialization for critical state transitions (#116).
 *
 * The event loop serializes requests within one process, but it does nothing
 * for interleaved async operations across pod replicas: two replicas can both
 * pass the idempotency check and both submit the same settlement to the chain.
 * The Redlock algorithm fixes that — a caller holds the lock only when a
 * quorum of independent Redis nodes agrees, so no single node's failure can
 * produce two holders.
 *
 * DEPLOYMENT SHAPE. Redlock wants an odd number (>= 3) of independent Redis
 * masters on separate failure domains; quorum is majority. REDLOCK_NODES is a
 * comma-separated list of those masters. With fewer than 3 nodes the lock
 * degrades to "majority of what exists" — still correct within that cluster,
 * but weaker failure isolation than the algorithm intends, and the boot log
 * says so. With no Redis at all the module falls back to an in-process mutex,
 * which keeps single-instance deployments correct and multi-instance ones no
 * worse than before this module existed.
 *
 * THE THREE GUARANTEES THIS MODULE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR:
 *
 *   1. Serialization — withLock() acquires before running, retrying until the
 *      acquire timeout; concurrent identical work waits instead of racing.
 *   2. Deadlock freedom — every lock carries a TTL and expires on its own, so
 *      a crashed holder cannot wedge a payment forever.
 *   3. Long-running safety — while the wrapped operation runs, the lock is
 *      re-extended (Fischer-Christian style) in the background, so an operation
 *      slower than the TTL does not lose exclusivity mid-flight. If extension
 *      fails, the operation is cancelled rather than allowed to continue
 *      unprotected.
 *
 * Fallback logic: if the Redlock quorum itself fails (all nodes down), the
 * module degrades to the in-process mutex and logs loudly — availability of
 * the endpoint is preserved, cross-process correctness is not silently
 * pretended.
