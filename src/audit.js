/**
 * Audit logging for sensitive operations (issue #109).
 *
 * An audit trail is a different artifact from diagnostic logging: it is a
 * record of who did what, retained and reviewed as such. It is deliberately
 * NOT a second logging framework — it is a thin, structured writer whose
 * records are distinguishable from diagnostics by the "channel": "audit"
 * marker on every line, so they can be shipped, filtered and retained
 * independently of application logs (#7 covers the diagnostic side).
 *
 * WHAT IS AUDITED is enumerated in docs/AUDIT.md with reasons. The rule of
 * thumb: record events that move or risk money, change public state, or
 * concern authentication — not reads.
 *
 * SANITISATION. Records carry identity (req.keyId, never the key material),
 * action, outcome, and just enough context to reconstruct the event (a
 * transaction hash). Full request payloads are never passed here, and as
 * defence in depth the writer redacts anything whose field name looks secret-
 * shaped before it leaves the process.
